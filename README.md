# VRChat-AI-Bot
Test to hook a VRChat user account up to an LLM, see what happens.

#README

#i recommend you setup your audio pipelines before you even go installing packages
#speaker needs to be mapped to microphone using VB-Audio Cable (for text to speech)
#microphone needs to be mapped to speaker using a physical aux cable connecting a speaker output to microphone input (for speech recognition)

#after that, test if it works by playing a youtube video and see if the script detects the youtube video's audio and the bot responds to it
#then, install packages and replace neccessary values such as your VRChat login and character AI api key

#character AI api key can be found here (https://docs.kram.cat/) run the first script on this page, input the link they email you, and thats your key for line 74
#input a character ai character into line 70
#input your vrchat credentials into lines 125 and 126
